# AI-project- Detecting emotion, Age, Gender in an image, video or webcam

Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications.

This Solution is able to detect faces in an image and can predict the Age, Gender, and Emotion of the person. It can also work in condition if there are multiple faces present in the image.
We will use a custom VGG16 model developed and trained on open source facial datasets downloaded from Kaggle and IMDB. OpenCV, dlib & keras were used to aid facial detection. The final system can detect the emotion, age and gender of people in any given image and by using a webcam.
